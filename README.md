## IIOT Module Description

Our ADC Input Module is made up of 2x 18bit 4 channel ADC`s allowing 8x analog signals to be sampled with accuracy.

The ADC Chips are MCP3424 which are low noise high accuracy 18-Bit delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter. These devices can convert analog inputs to digital codes with up to 18 bits of resolution.

Some main features of our ADC IIOT Module are:
* 8x ADC Channels at up to 18bits resolution
* One-Shot or Continuous Conversion Options
* Extended Temperature Range: -40°C to +125°C
* On-Board Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) - Gains of 1, 2, 4 or 8
* Easy to get connected and sampling
* On-board temperature measurements with the HDC1080 Temp and humidity sensor
